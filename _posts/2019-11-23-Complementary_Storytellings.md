# Ontology + Hauntology: Complementary Storytellings

Funky little mechanics  
tinker away  
at the apparatus  
determining superpositions  
through topological  
spacetimemattering

Sound and Vision composited through  
spacetimematter, knit together  
complementary storytellings

cut to driving home to work  
cut to drinking coffee  
cut to reading specters of marx  
cut to cutting together  
hauntologies as a vision mixer

We share what we measure as real  
even when we know  
the sharing  
is born of theft

We share our breath, our body, our vision  
drawing oxygen from a re-breather.  
The homology is realness  
with a valve with a twist

hard cut to sunshine diffracted upon the wall  
wipe to fingerprints ghosting an emulsion of silver halide  
and gelatin  
dissolve to non-destructive editing  
compositing media from other frames  
to generate animacy, realness, queereality

We haunt what we value,  
fixated on halls of  
obsessing over the tangles and wrongs  
attending to the splices that  
cut us together

To haunt or to hunt,  
we wiggle inside our confines  
and pace the cage--pacing the cage  
their time topologies immediate and centuries apart

What magic transforms a page to a path  
A trace of story and song  
shared with the folx down  
below  
in  
the  
undercommons

What words make things to us real  
in this night?
