Great news Solar Collaborative! I plan on embracing my ghostly nature as a queer/trans/non-binary person haunting the halls of academia, and will build out some of my writing here, at Heliotactic Press. I know, Iâ€™m likely going to be the only one reading this space, but it will be my own space. These new posts are explorations of the small, ordinary affects in the life of a queer scholar who works among STEM and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, (arts), Mathematics) communities.

Time to shift and transform from geometries to topologies, from representative analogies to enacted homologies, from scale to relationships among phenomena. Will it make sense? Will it be useful? I hope so, really. Because I need this artistic channel to express what is compressed and repressed by my place of work and the oil, gas, and coal community that I am required to inhabit to earn my keep. I really need a break to just have fun with language and to just *be a spooky ghost* of quantum indeterminacy, writing about feminism, anti-colonial practices, and collective action. Writing about the trace of these revolutionary practices in the solar work that we do every day, in our own space of the Undercommons.

- All statements are my own, and do not reflect the views of anyone else but this queer spooky ghost of gendering, art making, and exploring affect through my days.
