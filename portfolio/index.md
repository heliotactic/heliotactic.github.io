Because solar energy is photovoltaics, and so much more...

## Community Solar

We are working on a new space called [Community Solar](http://www.communitysolar.psu.edu/), addressing the new trends for differentiated models of shared solar deployment. This space is based on the work of [Community Solar on State](http://sustainability.psu.edu/reinvention/community-solar-on-state): a Living Laboratory Framework for Outreach, Education, and Research-- funded by the Reinvention Fund of [Penn State's Sustainability Institute](http://sustainability.psu.edu/).

Penn State has developed a strong community interest and passion for solar energy research and development. The students, staff, and faculty, and our surrounding community deserve a path to enable the low-carbon future to grow photovoltaic (PV) installations in the framework of the Living Laboratory. We also wish to create an outreach and educational platform that will allow our community to proceed with a pilot community PV project, called a “solar garden”, retain the best practices learned, and then move forward with enabling prospective solar projects as they evolve in the future.
