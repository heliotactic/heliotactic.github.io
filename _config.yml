description: 
  "Solar photovoltaics (PV) are the bellwether for the broad solar field, 
  growing at an alarming rate internationally. This surge is transforming energy 
  landscapes, both figurative and literal. The exponential, contagious surge of 
  PV systems internationally is enabling innovation in solar, in tandem with 
  historical reflection on the deep influence of solar conversion on our 
  supporting ecosystems. We argue that solar energy must be addressed as a 
  transformative, transdisciplinary framework for research and adaptive design: 
  solar ecology. There are rich opportunities within the food-energy-water nexus, 
  motivated by the need to understand our local regimes and pose sustainable 
  adaption planning given a climate changed by 2100."
