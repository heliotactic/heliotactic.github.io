My current academic home is known internationally for traditional fossil fuel endeavors: mining, oil and gas production, post-extractive environmental remediation, and fuel combustion. Over the last 12 years, my solar energy practices enact localized, feminist, anti-colonial values and measurements oriented in opposition to those massive colonial extractive traditions. And yet the enrichment and resilience of my solar work at Penn State has emerged and evolved as a result of that long-term tension within a fossil fuel culture. 

On Sept. 6, 2019, I attended the groundbreaking of Penn Stateâ€™s 70 MW solar photovoltaic farm, joined by four female students of our Solar Collaborative. The celebratory event included comments from Governor Tom Wolf and President Eric Barron. The 500 acre solar farm will be the largest in PA to date and will contribute at least $14 million savings for this University, along with years of educational and research opportunities. This physically significant project is a direct outcome of my research, teaching, and service at Penn State.
