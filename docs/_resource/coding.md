## Coding Supplements for Students and Educators

The calculation of parameters in solar energy are facilitated with software algorithms, particularly for chapters 3-8. As such, we have developed coding algorithms for Python (or Jupyter) to facilitate the learning process. A list of coding examples will be accumulating soon.

## Answers to Problem Sets for Educators

The problem sets at the end of the chapter have been worked through and is available to qualified educators. The approval process is managed through Elsevier. 

<!-- ## Standard Notation

For the most part, this course will rely on standard solar notation established in 1978 for the journal, Solar Energy. A paper on the subject is available here. I use the 1978 standard notation in our class lectures and the textbook.

Exception: for some algorithms, we will use an alternate convention for orientation/azimuth, where the equator is the critical spatial constraint, not North or South. As such, the solar azimuth or collector azimuth is divided into negative (-0 to -180 degrees) for East, pre-noon directions; and positive (+0 to +180 degrees) for West, post-noon angles. This convention applies equally for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The choice of basis affects the form of the spherical trigonometric algorithms developed to calculate the angles of incidence. -->
