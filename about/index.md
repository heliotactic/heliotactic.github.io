## Bio 

Frey Brownson’s work through the Solar Collaborative at Penn State emerges as an archive of diffraction experiments through stakeholders, spacetimemattering, and following disruptive changes in our world. They study solar resource assessment/economics, photovoltaic materials, and systems performance for photovoltaics and buildings. A non-binary person in STEM and the arts, they participated in the DoE SunShot initiative "Finding Pennsylvania's Solar Future", the DoE SunShot Initiative for Solar Forecasting, the DoE Energy Efficient Buildings Hub in PA, and served as faculty lead in the DoE Solar Decathlon 2009. Brownson has engaged their solar community as a member of the Board of Directors for the American Solar Energy Society from 2013-2016, advocating the critical importance of our young professionals in the health and future of the solar industry.  

## Solar Ecology in Brief

For over 10,000 years, **the story of solar has been the story of society**. Re-configuring the boundaries of energy conversion for the entangled present, solar ecology affects and is affecting our naturecultures as *farming*. Solar ecology is farming. Solar Ecology offers the tools of *energy exploration* and local enrichment, within which "light" is the dominant vehicle for change. Solar energy, measured as light, must be addressed as a transformative, transdisciplinary framework for survival and adaptive design and planning. There are new and old opportunities to be accessed in our own locales, our local regimes of natureculture, community, sense of place. 

Solar Ecology emerges today as a web sustainable adaption planning given a climate changed by 2100. The `solar ecology` framework has emerged as a new school of thought for research and design at the interface of light, society, and our supporting ecosystems.

> `Solar ecology` is farming. By this, I mean *solar ecology* attends to the systems framework of discovery and design associated with **solar energy conversion** writ large, coupled with the dynamic context of `locale` (e.g. a regime of place and time), the affected `stakeholders`, and the diverse technologies or ecosystems providing preferred solar goods and services (i.e. `solar utility`).
 
`Solar photovoltaics` are established global commodities, and solar electricity is being planned at the gigawatt scale internationally. This growth has coincided with a rapid maturation of the solar field, involving a grand opportunity to explore other solar goods and services in the wake of photovoltaic successes. The work of `solar ecology` explores solar in transition, moving from a wave of photovoltaic growth as of now, toward major global food-energy-water impacts in the next century. `Solar utility` is the vehicle aiding project development in solar ecology, describing stakeholders’ preferences for solar goods and services, fit within the dynamic perspective of the `locale`. The broader field of `solar ecology` is an emerging transdisciplinary systems field of solar energy within the context of the environment, society and technology--connecting science with design, business, lifestyle, health, and well-being.

## Solar Ecology in the Media

**Focus on Research: Solar ecology explores the challenges in solar energy**
An editorial commentary that I developed to frame `solar ecology` in 2015. This peice preceded our first all-day workshop on "Solar Ecology: Exploring the Grand Challenges in Solar Energy", held on Dec. 4, 2015 at the Earth and Mineral Sciences Energy Institute, University Park, PA.

## Research Overview

Solar Ecology practices require stakeholders to explore and engage new topologies of relational ontologies, epistemology, and ethics according to the new measures and valuation of light. The processes  of measuring and valuation include attending to solar resource supply and use, systems design, distribution needs, predictive economic models for a fluctuating resource, and involve planning to address transient cycles and social adoption. Contextual knowledge of constraints from the local solar resource, local energy costs, and local policy (termed `locale` by Brownson) informs the research and design process to integrate solar energy conversion systems within building systems, with respect to community planning, and within the interconnection of distributed photovoltaic power generation across broad regions. 

The context-dependent constraints guiding design and purpose in the systemic interactions of humans/biota with their surrounding environments then opens up the language for the science of the `solar ecology` framework, transdisciplinary research within the context of the environment, society and technology—affecting water and food systems coupled to local weather regimes. Dr. Brownson’s research reveals solar energy’s ubiquitous influence on water, land use, ecosystems services, food systems, and social systems, demonstrating how the solar ecology framework contributes to a shared new wave of discoveries and social change. The research and language underpinning solar utility and solar ecology expands the interpretation of solar energy conversion as an inclusive whole-systems dynamic process, bringing the field of solar energy to a new and broader interdisciplinary audience, enabling discussion for strategies assessing the solar resource (energy exploration techniques) and for integrative design of solar systems. Brownson collaborators include researchers in the fields of **Economics, Energy Engineering, Geography, Law, Materials, Meteorology, and Rural Sociology**.

Frey contributes unique expertise and skill for the measurement and analysis of the dynamic solar resource, the development of geospatial solar tools, and dynamic energy simulations for solar photovoltaics. They exercises their skills in solar science to extend applied research capabilities for design of solar energy conversion systems, and to enhance policy and planning strategies to assess project risks and benefits associated with diverse solar goods and services. They work to facilitate and maintain entangled meshes of collaboration though many disciplines and civic-academic gratings, to convey new and effective tools in solar science and solar project design. This depth of primary solar knowledge combined with the broad skill set in communication has opened up a large network of faculty collaborators in education and research at Penn State as well as collaborators abroad in Korea, Germany, Canada, and Burkina Faso of West Africa.
