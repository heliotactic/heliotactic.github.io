## Context for Solar

Solar energy conversion is a field containing systems thinking, applied science, and engineering; there are a lot of linked components in the system to keep track of in the design, implementation, and maintenance processes. To design technologies relevant to each region requires knowledge of the social context, the energy demands and economic constraints of a client or stakeholders, as well as knowledge of the specific locale or region, considering the quantity and character of the solar resource. 

## Solar Ecology

For over 10,000 years, the story of solar has been the story of society. We argue that solar energy must be addressed as a transformative, transdisciplinary framework for nexus research and adaptive design: solar ecology; with rich opportunities motivated by the need to understand our local regimes and pose sustainable adaption planning given a climate changed by 2100. We present the solar ecology framework for research and design at the interface of ecosystems and society.
