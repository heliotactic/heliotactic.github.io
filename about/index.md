Dr. Brownson has worked to develop a new school of thought in solar energy called Solar Ecology.

## Context for Solar

Solar energy conversion is a field containing systems thinking, applied science, and engineering; there are a lot of linked components in the system to keep track of in the design, implementation, and maintenance processes. To design technologies relevant to each region requires knowledge of the social context, the energy demands and economic constraints of a client or stakeholders, as well as knowledge of the specific locale or region, considering the quantity and character of the solar resource. 

## Solar Ecology

For over 10,000 years, **the story of solar has been the story of society**. We are also embedded in a new age of *energy exploration* and discovery, within which "solar" is the dominant vehicle for change. Solar energy must be addressed as a transformative, transdisciplinary framework for nexus research and adaptive design, with rich opportunities motivated by the need to understand our local regimes and pose sustainable adaption planning given a climate changed by 2100. Hence, the `solar ecology` framework has emerged as a new school of thought for research and design at the interface of light, society, and our supporting ecosystems.

> `Solar ecology` is the systems framework of discovery and design associated with **solar energy conversion** writ large, coupled with the dynamic context of `locale` (e.g. a regime of place and time), the affected `stakeholders`, and the diverse technologies or ecosystems providing preferred solar goods and services (i.e. `solar utility`).
 
`Solar photovoltaics` are established global commodities, and solar
electricity is being planned at the gigawatt scale internationally. This growth has coincided with a rapid maturation of the solar field, involving a grand opportunity to explore other solar goods and services in the wake of photovoltaic successes. The work of `solar ecology` explores solar in transition, moving from a wave of photovoltaic growth as of now, toward major global food-energy-water impacts in the next century. `Solar utility` is the vehicle aiding project development in solar ecology, describing stakeholders’ preferences for solar goods and services, fit within the dynamic perspective of the `locale`. The broader field of `solar ecology` is an emerging transdisciplinary systems field of solar energy within the context of the environment, society and technology--connecting science with design, business, lifestyle, health, and well-being.

## Solar Ecology in the Media

**Focus on Research: Solar ecology explores the challenges in solar energy**
An editorial commentary that I developed to frame `solar ecology` in 2015. This peice preceded our first all-day workshop on "Solar Ecology: Exploring the Grand Challenges in Solar Energy", held on Dec. 4, 2015 at the Earth and Mineral Sciences Energy Institute, University Park, PA.
