## Image Description

Sketch in colored pen and ink on 3x5" grid note card. A pink/yellow arc of a fire, a burn zone of queerness, affinity and toxity consuming capital, matter, and growth.

In the shadow of the burn, the wastelands queering Animacies and Toxic Affectivity decribed by author Mel Y. Chen in "Animacies: Biopolitics, Racial Mattering, and Queer Affect" (2012) on pp. 206-207. "they truck with negativity, marginality, and sub-obj confusions"
